# ASAP Scouting API

Description:
There should be two parts to the system, an API, and a Client. The API would do all the work and the client just has to connect to get the information. The API will be a RESTful Json Web API (similar to thebluealliance.com). The Client provided here would just be an example on how the API works and how to handle the responses. 

Notes:

1. A "hosted" version of the API could be made. To use it someone would just have to register for an account, and they would be able to recived API tokens.
2. The API must be fully PSR compliant.
3. Adequate documentation must be made available.
4. Use JWTs for authentication.
5. Should be completely stateless.
